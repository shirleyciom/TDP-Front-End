/*
**Script 

Break up code into 3 sections 
 -variable 

let element = document.query 

 -methods - are actions we want to perform
 button 
 let handle click = function {
     console.log(event) 
 }
This links to the event listner 


 -event listners (these are things like clicking typing text entry) 
element.addeventlistner 

Code should be broken up the same as c# does with classes etc 


DOM - Document Object Model
