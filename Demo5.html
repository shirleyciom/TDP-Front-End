       // Demo 1 - Arrow Functions clean up code!
      //Allow for clear, concise code.
      // ECMAScript 5

      let button = document.querySelector('#submitBtn')



button.addEventListener('click', () => {

    alert("I was clicked");

    console.log(this);       //DOM Elemment

}, false);

  





        //Demo 2
        //   Functions create a new context for this based on how it is called 
        //   â€“ i.e. if the function belongs to a DOM object and that function is called from 
        //   the DOM object then this refers to the DOM object
        //   Arrow functions are a convenient shorthand for writing an anonymous function 
        //   that does not create a new context for this. Which can be very helpful, but also a gotcha when used in situations, 
        //   such as event handlers

         //let button = document.querySelector('#submitBtn')
    
        //    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        //     alert("I was clicked"); 
        //     console.log(this);       //DOM Elemment
        //    }, false);









        
    //Syntactically anonymous

    //     It is important to note that arrow functions are anonymous, 
    //     which means that they are not named.

    //     This anonymity creates some issues:

    //     1. Harder to debug
    //     When you get an error, you will not be able to trace the name of the function 
    //     or the exact line number where it occurred.

    //    2. No self-referencing

    //    If your function needs to have a self-reference at any point 
    //    (e.g. recursion, event handler that needs to unbind), it will not work.
